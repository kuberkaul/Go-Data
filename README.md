Go-Data
=======

Go-Data is a web based data management system which is similar in sense to dropbox but is more 'intelligent' as it uses random merking algoirithm to implement a caching system which makes it much faster. Also we deploy a system client based on Tkinter and which can sync data directly from your local drive to server. We implement Apriori algorihtm for intelligent prefetching of data in case of first five files.
